This will be a negative number since you are dividing a positive number by a negative number. The resulting quotient will be negative as well. 3. Place the quotient above the dividend digit you just divided into, and multiply the quotient by the divisor (-13). Write this product under the first portion of the dividend. 4. Subtract the product from the portion of the dividend you just multiplied, and bring down the next digit (4). 5.

The result should be approximately -0.000000001424. If you prefer to do the long division manually, you can follow these steps: - Write -4 as the dividend and 2807133 as the divisor. - Add a decimal point to the dividend to make it a decimal number. So, -4 becomes -4.0. - Divide the first digit of the dividend by the divisor. In this case, 2 goes into 4 zero times with a remainder of 4. - Bring down the next digit (0) from the dividend and place it next to the remainder to get 40. - Divide 28 into 40.

However, the follow-up part of the problem asks to solve it without converting the integer to a string.  To solve this problem without using string conversion, we can extract the digits from the integer one by one and compare the first digit with the last digit, second digit with second last digit, and so on. If all the pairs match, the integer is a palindrome, otherwise it is not. There are a few edge cases we need to handle: If the integer is negative, it cannot be a palindrome as the minus sign will be part of the digits. If the integer ends with a zero, it can only be a palindrome if it is zero. We can extract the last digit of an integer using the modulo operator (%) and remove the last digit from an integer using integer division (/). We continue this process until the entire integer is consumed. Here\'s the Java code that implements this approach: class Solution {   public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {     // Special cases:     // Negative integers are not palindromes     // Integers that end in 0 can only be palindromes if they are 0     if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {       return false;     }     int reversed = 0;     while (x > reversed) {       int digit = x % 10;       reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;       x /= 10;     }     return x == reversed || x == reversed / 10;   } } Time Complexity: O(log10n), where n is the input integer.

The smaller head is removed from its list and the process is repeated with the shorter remaining list and the other list until one of the lists is empty. The recursive algorithm can be implemented using the above Java code. The base cases are when either list1 or list2 is null. In this case, the other list is returned as it is already sorted. The recursive case starts by comparing the heads of the two lists and choosing the smaller one. The smaller head becomes the next node in the merged list, and the next node in the merged list is the result of the recursive call with the shorter list and the other list.

We can start with two pointers at the two ends of the array (i.e., left and right pointers). The area of the container formed by the two lines is given by the formula: area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left). Initially, the width of the container is maximum (i.e., right - left is maximum), and we want to find the maximum height for this width. So, we move the pointer that corresponds to the shorter line, hoping to find a taller line that will increase the area of the container. For each move of the pointer, we update the maximum area seen so far. We keep doing this until the two pointers meet (i.e., left >= right). At the end, the maximum area seen so far is the answer.

We define dp[i][j] as a boolean value indicating whether s[0:i-1] matches p[0:j-1], i.e., the substrings of s and p up to the ith and jth characters, respectively. The base cases are dp[0][0] = true (empty string matches empty pattern) and dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-2] if p[j-1] = \'*\' (zero match). For the general cases, we need to consider three possibilities: 1. s[i-1] matches p[j-1] or p[j-1] = \'.\'. In this case, we can just inherit the result of dp[i-1][j-1], since the current character matches. 2. p[j-1] = \'*\'. In this case, we can have two sub-cases: (1) Zero match: we can ignore the last two characters of p, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2], since the \'*\' matches zero preceding element. (2) One or more match: the \'*\' matches one or more of the preceding element. Thus, we need to check whether s[i-1] matches p[j-2] or p[j-2] = \'.\', and then inherit the result of dp[i-1][j], i.e., whether s[0:i-2] matches p[0:j-1].

This function will return the new head of the reversed list. We can use the iterative approach to reverse the linked list. Keep track of the previous, current, and next nodes while traversing the list, and update the next pointers accordingly. Define the main function reverseKGroup that takes the head of the linked list and the value of k.  Initialize a dummy node as the new head of the modified list. Set the dummy node\'s next pointer to the original head. Initialize a pointer prev to the dummy node, which will keep track of the last node in the already reversed group. Iterate through the linked list and group the nodes in groups of size k. If there are less than k nodes remaining, no further reversal is possible, so break the loop. Otherwise, reverse the current group of k nodes using the reverseLinkedList function. Update the pointers of the previous group and the current group to maintain the correct connections. Return the dummy node\'s next pointer as the new head of the modified list.

The reverseLinkedList helper function is used to reverse a group of k nodes at a time. The main function uses a dummy node and keeps track of the previous group\'s last node to maintain the correct connections during the reversal process.  To solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space, we can modify the reverseLinkedList function to perform the reversal in-place without using any additional memory. Instead of creating a new reversed list, we can modify the original list in place.

Here\'s the step-by-step algorithm:  Initialize an empty result list to store the starting indices of concatenated substrings. Check for edge cases: If the length of the string s is smaller than the total length of all words combined, return an empty result list. If the words array is empty, return an empty result list. Create a HashMap called wordCounts to store the frequency of each word in the words array. Iterate over each word in the words array and update its frequency in wordCounts. Determine the length of each word in the words array (since all words have the same length) and store it in the variable wordLength. Iterate over the string s using a sliding window with a fixed length of wordLength * words.length. Initialize a new HashMap called seen to keep track of the occurrences of words in the current window. Initialize the variable wordCount to keep track of the number of words seen in the current window. Iterate over the sliding window using the variable i as the starting index: Extract the current word from the sliding window by slicing s from i to i + wordLength. If the current word is not present in the wordCounts HashMap, reset the seen HashMap, wordCount, and move the sliding window by wordLength. Otherwise, update the frequency of the current word in the seen HashMap and increment wordCount. If the frequency of the current word in the seen HashMap is greater than its frequency in the wordCounts HashMap, move the sliding window by wordLength and decrement wordCount. If wordCount is equal to words.length, it means all words have been found in the sliding window. Add the starting index of the sliding window to the result list. Move the sliding window by wordLength. Return the result list containing the starting indices of concatenated substrings.

We iterate through the string and for each character: - If it is a \'(\', we push its index onto the stack. - If it is a \')\', we pop the top index from the stack (if the stack is not empty), which represents the matching opening bracket for this closing bracket. We then update the length of the longest valid substring by taking the maximum of the current length and the difference between the current index (of the closing bracket) and the index we just popped (of the matching opening bracket). After we finish iterating through the string, we may still have some opening indices left on the stack, which means they don\'t have matching closing brackets. We can use these indices to calculate the lengths of valid substrings at the end of the string. Here\'s the Java code for this approach: class Solution {   public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {     if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {       return 0;     }     int n = s.length();     int maxLen = 0;     Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();     stack.push(-1); // dummy index     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {       char c = s.charAt(i);       if (c == \'(\') {         stack.push(i);       } else if (c == \')\') {         if (!stack.isEmpty()) {           stack.pop();           if (!stack.isEmpty()) {             int len = i - stack.peek();             maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len);           } else {             stack.push(i);           }         } else {           stack.push(i);         }       }     }     return maxLen;   } } Note that we use a dummy index (-1) as the initial index on the stack, so that we can avoid checking for an empty stack when we try to calculate the length of the first valid substring.

We can start iterating over all the cells in the Sudoku puzzle and for each empty cell, we can try all the possible numbers that can be filled in that cell (from 1 to 9). We can then check if the number we just filled in satisfies all the rules of Sudoku (i.e., it doesn\'t appear in the same row, column or 3x3 sub-box as any other cell with that same number). If the number satisfies all the rules, we can move on to the next empty cell and try filling a number in that cell. If a cell cannot be filled with any number that satisfies the rules of Sudoku, we need to backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number. If we are able to fill all the cells in the puzzle with valid numbers, we have solved the Sudoku puzzle. Algorithm: 1. Create a function that solves the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. 2.

We can use the fact that the missing element must be within the range [1, n+1] (where n is the length of the array), since there are at most n positive integers in the array and the missing integer should be the next one after them. To utilize constant extra space, we can modify the original array instead of using extra space. We first mark all non-positive elements as n+1 since they cannot be the missing positive integer. Then we mark visited positive integers by negating the element at its corresponding index-1 (i.e. if we see a positive number i, we mark nums[i-1] as negative).

We can initialize two pointers, i and j, pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. Then, we can iterate through the array, at each step comparing the values of height[i] and height[j]. We can keep track of the maximum height on the left and right sides, and update them as we iterate through the array. If height[i] is less than height[j], we can check if height[i] is higher than the maximum height on the left. If it is, we update the maximum height on the left, and calculate the amount of water that can be trapped at height[i] as the difference between this maximum height and height[i]. We can add this amount of water to a variable that keeps track of the total amount of water trapped. Similarly, if height[j] is less than height[i], we can check if height[j] is higher than the maximum height on the right, and update the maximum height on the right accordingly. Here\'s the Java code that implements this algorithm: public int trap(int[] height) {   int n = height.length;   int left = 0, right = n - 1;   int maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;   int water = 0;   while (left <= right) {     if (height[left] <= height[right]) {       if (height[left] >= maxLeft) {         maxLeft = height[left];       } else {         water += maxLeft - height[left];       }       left++;     } else {       if (height[right] >= maxRight) {         maxRight = height[right];       } else {         water += maxRight - height[right];       }       right--;     }   }   return water; } The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), since we iterate through the array only once.

We define dp[i][j] to be a boolean value indicating whether the first i characters of string s match the first j characters of pattern p. The base cases are dp[0][0] = true (empty pattern matches empty string), and dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] if p[j-1] == \'*\' (since \'*\' can match any sequence). For the general cases, we consider three possibilities: If p[j-1] matches s[i-1] or p[j-1] == \'?\', then we can match one character, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. If p[j-1] == \'*\', then we have two choices: (1) match any sequence of characters by using \'*\' to match s[i-1], i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]; or (2) skip \'*\' and continue matching the rest of the pattern, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1].
